Keep Your Glitch Project Always Online
=================

## Just wait for a few secs
> Glitch automatically saves the file, quite literally, on every keypress you make. And restarts it. This is not only slightly visually annoying, but also damaging to bots.

## I ping me myself
> Glitch is made to be a web hosting really, and will "sleep" after 5 minutes if it receives no HTTP request. However, there is a very convenient way to keep it alive, which is actually provided by the app itself - the express.js module is pre-installed, and all you need to do is to "ping" it every 5 minutes to make sure it doesn't sleep.


Click `Show` in the header to see your app live. Updates to your code will instantly deploy and update live.

**Glitch** is the friendly community where you'll build the app of your dreams. Glitch lets you instantly create, remix, edit, and host an app, bot or site, and you can invite collaborators or helpers to simultaneously edit code with you.

Your Project
------------

On the front-end,
- edit `public/client.js`, `public/style.css` and `views/index.html`
- drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project

On the back-end,
- your app starts at `server.js`
- add frameworks and packages in `package.json`
- safely store app secrets in `.env` (nobody can see this but you and people you invite)
